After our conversation, I calmed down and agreed to hospitalization. The surgery lasted 9.5 hours and after it, the entire staff was by my side. Every day I communicated with the team and was amazed at how attentive and positive the doctors were and how kind and caring the nurses were. I gradually recovered by the sixth day and am preparing for discharge. I have only positive impressions of the Soyuz Clinic and its work. Huge thanks for saving me. I thank God I ended up here.

This second chance at life was given by wonderful doctor Valentina Mikhailovna Nechushkina and her team. My story began in autumn 2022 with an acute abdomen, difficulty breathing, scapula pain, abdominal swelling. Examination revealed unfortunate diagnosis—stage III high-grade ovarian cancer with ascites. Oncology dispensary suggested chemotherapy then surgery. I searched for a surgeon. Thank God I met an acquaintance who recommended the International project \"Health-Direct\" and the Eurasian Oncology Program (EAFO), consulting the best oncologists. So I came to Valentina Mikhailovna Nechushkina. She explained everything in detail (including diagrams) about the diagnosis, consequences, and treatment. Successful treatment depends on primary complete cytoreductive surgery, followed by chemotherapy. Leaving the office, I felt like on wings. After signing the contract, I was in the hands of a professional team focused on results. Attentiveness and kindness of doctors and the possibility of staying in touch at all stages impressed me. The complex surgery lasted 11 hours removing 14 items including liver ligament, uterus with adnexa, metastases with rectum, greater omentum, spleen, pancreas, stomach wall, gall bladder, appendix. Later I learned such surgeries involve multi-specialists: abdominal surgeons, urologists, etc. World-class surgeons Valentina Mikhailovna Nechushkina and Kirill Alexandrovich Shemyatovsky performed full cytoreduction. Deep gratitude to surgeons, project leader Dr. Soma, anesthesiologist Aleksey Olegovich Prikhodchenko, intensivists Oleg Vladislavovich Baydal, Pavel Viktorovich Vyatkin, nurses, secretaries.

Cancer patients often hear, ‘We are not gods...’ Maybe so, but not about wonderful surgeon, gynecologist, oncologist Valentina Mikhailovna Nechushkina. All patients and colleagues say: ‘She’s second only to God! Valentina Mikhailovna is the hands of God in our world!’ Diagnosed with stage III ovarian cancer with peritoneal metastases in Feb 2022. Terrified and confused how to start treatment, living in a small town with previous regular checks but late diagnosis due to negligence or low doctor professionalism. Life depended on surgeon’s professionalism. Blessed I found Valentina Mikhailovna! You immediately feel safe with her. After thorough evaluation and long consultation, surgery lasted 9 hours. Local surgeon was shocked seeing discharge papers ‘Wow you had half your abdomen removed!’ But I remain alive thanks to Valentina Mikhailovna and team. Post-op she guided chemo and genetic tests, found hereditary gene mutation, prescribed expert treatment unknown locally, monitors my course, is always reachable day or night. Dear women facing similar situations: don’t hesitate—only Valentina Mikhailovna. She’s unsurpassed, confirmed by patients and doctors. Other doctors praise her surgery and skill. Dear Valentina Mikhailovna, God bless you and your team! Sincere thanks to Dr. Soma, Kirill Alexandrovich Shemyatovsky, Aleksey Olegovich Prikhodchenko, Pavel Viktorovich Vyatkin, Oleg Vladislavovich Baydal. God bless!"

Husband found a doctor through a friend who advised Health-Direct. It felt like a different world. Clear plan given first by phone. First, met Valentina Mikhailovna Nechushkina in person. Skeptical about reviews, but after five minutes knew she was the right doctor. Consultation lasted three hours; she patiently answered questions without hurry or condescension. First impression: my doctor! Within five days, completed 19 complicated diagnostics thanks to Health-Direct managers. Most frightening was surgery, but Valentina Mikhailovna reassured. Long-term collaboration with the same anesthesia team ensures great results. Next day after surgery, I could sit and walk around ICU. Transferred to my room, care continued. Simple things like hydration, walking, diet, and social interaction quickly restored me. Immense gratitude to Valentina Mikhailovna and her team!"

Thankfully, smart and sensible people nearby advised me to contact Health-Direct. That month flew by like a fast train, and only now do I realize how much had to be done and why. We got confirmation that the cancer was only in the lung. Then I went for more testing to find out what kind of cancer I had. After all this, I received my first chemotherapy session in December. Chemotherapy was administered by oncologist Dmitry Yuryevich Sinyavin, who also supervised my care. He is a very attentive and responsible doctor. I had a total of six chemotherapy sessions. After four sessions, based on the oncology board’s decision, Dmitry Yuryevich advised radiation therapy. I underwent 30 sessions. One month after that, a CT scan showed positive progress. This gave me hope, but the last two chemotherapy infusions were difficult for me. It turned out that a whole team of doctors was involved, and they got me to my last session on time. Now, I am completely cancer-free! Looking back at the past six months, I am immensely grateful to oncologist Dmitry Yuryevich Sinyavin, radiotherapist Aleksandr Evgenyevich Pankratov, and the entire Health-Direct team for the correct treatment plan (it was very different from what would have been given where I live)! More such doctors, please! Thanks to you, I can go on living and see my newly born granddaughter grow up!",

In our clinic, we combine international standards of oncological care with attentive and caring attitude towards each patient. Our team provides modern antitumor treatment based on scientific evidence and clinical experience, creating all conditions for comfortable therapy.<br/><br/>We accompany the patient at every stage — from diagnosis to recovery, helping to maintain quality of life and inner balance.<br/><br/><b>Accurate diagnosis is the foundation of successful treatment.</b><br/><br/>At HDMC, the diagnostic process is organized in accordance with international clinical protocols. Patients undergo a full range of examinations — laboratory, instrumental and molecular genetic studies, imaging methods (MRI, CT, PET/CT) — quickly, safely and in comfortable conditions. This approach allows not only to determine the stage and characteristics of the tumor, but also to select personalized therapy specifically for your type of disease. All decisions are made collectively at the oncological council.<br/><br/>We pay great attention to informing the patient and their family — we explain in detail all stages of therapy, possible side effects and methods of their prevention.<br/><br/><b>Modern methods of drug therapy</b><br/><br/>HDMC uses all modern types of antitumor drug treatment.<br/>The choice of method is always individual — depending on the type and stage of the tumor, concomitant diseases and the patient's general condition.<br/>The main goal of therapy is to maximally effectively affect the tumor while maintaining quality of life.<br/><br/><b>Chemotherapy</b><br/><br/>Chemotherapy remains one of the main methods of treating malignant tumors.<br/>Its task is to stop the growth and spread of tumor cells.<br/>At HDMC, chemotherapy is conducted according to international protocols, with precise selection of dosages and administration regimens. We use both classical and modern drugs with improved tolerability profiles. Treatment is accompanied by supportive therapy that helps minimize side effects — nausea, weakness, reduced immunity.<br/>Patients are under constant supervision of doctors and nurses, and all procedures are performed in the comfortable conditions of a day hospital.<br/><br/><b>Targeted Therapy</b><br/><br/>Targeted therapy acts on specific molecules involved in the growth of tumor cells. Such treatment works selectively, almost without affecting healthy tissues. Before prescription, molecular genetic testing of the tumor is performed to determine the presence of targets for targeted drugs.<br/>This allows selecting treatment that is maximally effective for this particular patient.<br/><br/>Advantages:<br/><ul class='list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-2'><li>high precision and selectivity of action;</li><li>lower toxicity compared to classical chemotherapy;</li><li>possibility of long-term use without hospitalization;</li><li>maintenance of usual lifestyle during treatment.</li></ul><br/><b>Immunotherapy</b><br/><br/>Immunotherapy helps the body fight the tumor on its own by activating its own immune system. HDMC uses modern drugs — immune checkpoint inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies acting at the cellular mechanism level. Immunotherapy can be used both independently and in combination with other methods. It has the potential for long-term disease control and formation of sustainable antitumor immunity with good tolerability.<br/><br/><b>Endocrine Therapy</b><br/><br/>Endocrine (hormonal) therapy is used for tumors sensitive to hormones — for example, breast cancer or prostate cancer.<br/>The goal of treatment is to block the effects of hormones that stimulate tumor growth.<br/>Treatment is conducted in the form of tablet preparations or injections, often — on an outpatient basis. Endocrine therapy is easily tolerated, suitable for long-term use and allows patients to maintain their usual active life.<br/><br/><b>Supportive Therapy</b><br/><br/>Supportive therapy is an integral part of treatment at HDMC.<br/>It is aimed at maintaining quality of life, preventing and correcting possible side effects.<br/>We apply:<br/><ul class='list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-2'><li>antiemetic therapy;</li><li>prevention of neutropenia and anemia;</li><li>nutritional support (individual nutrition);</li><li>pain control;</li><li>psychological support.</li></ul><br/>Oncological treatment is a journey that requires not only professionalism but also support.

      "title": "Placement of a Venous Port System for Chemotherapy",
      "subtitle": "Venous Port System Placement",
      "btn": "Book",
      "about": "<b>What is a port system?</b><br/><br/>A port system consists of a catheter placed into a central vein and a chamber to which the catheter is connected. It is implanted under the skin in the subclavian area. For prolonged courses of chemotherapy, this is the most optimal option for comfortable treatment. In addition, a port system can be used for blood sampling, prolonged antibacterial therapy, parenteral nutrition, and/or frequent blood transfusions. Like any catheter, a port system can be used to administer contrast agents for MRI and CT or to deliver any intravenous medications.<br/><br/><b>Possible contraindications for port system placement</b><br/><br/>Placement of a port system is recommended by the physician based on clinical data and the treatment plan. Each case is considered individually, since all listed contraindications are relative. However, implantation should be approached with caution in the following cases:<br/><ul class='list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2'><li>blood clotting disorders;</li><li>individual intolerance to port materials;</li><li>radiation therapy at the intended implantation site;</li><li>superior vena cava syndrome;</li><li>inflammation of the skin at the implantation site;</li><li>sepsis.</li></ul><br/><b>How is port system placement performed?</b><br/><br/>The procedure for placing a port system is not considered an operation and takes 30–90 minutes. The implantation site is disinfected, a local anesthetic is administered, the vein is punctured and the catheter is inserted. A small skin incision of no more than 3–4 cm is made, a subcutaneous pocket is formed, and the port system is placed in it. The incision is closed with cosmetic sutures, which fully heal within 2–3 weeks. The implantation site is protected with a special dressing that can be removed by the patient later.<br/><br/><b>What does the patient feel after the procedure?</b><br/><br/>The port system is perceived by the body as a foreign object, so pulling, aching and tingling sensations at the implantation site are normal. People have different pain thresholds; to reduce discomfort, painkillers prescribed by the treating physician can be taken immediately after implantation if necessary. Discomfort should completely subside one week after the procedure. Any unpleasant sensations are a reason to contact a physician immediately.<br/><br/>Also, in the early period after port implantation it is recommended to limit certain routine activities:<br/><ul class='list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2'><li>avoid lifting heavy objects (over 5 kg) for 7 days;</li><li>limit visits to pools, baths, and saunas for 14–28 days;</li><li>refrain from intense physical exercise for 7 days.</li></ul><br/><br/><b>How to prepare for the procedure?</b><br/><ul class='list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2'><li>Consult with the specialist who will place the port system and discuss timing and location of implantation.</li><li>Prepare and provide the physician with copies of tests and examinations:</li><li>complete blood count with leukocyte formula and platelet count – valid for 14 days;<ul class=' list-inside space-y-2 ml-6'><li>- complete urine analysis – valid for 14 days;</li><li>- biochemical blood tests (total protein, glucose, total bilirubin, creatinine, urea, ALT, AST) – valid for 14 days;</li><li>- coagulogram (fibrinogen, APTT, INR) – valid for 14 days;</li><li>- blood group and Rh factor – valid for 3 months or after the last transfusion if one was given within the last 3 months (on a form with an original stamp);</li><li>- phenotype – valid for 3 months or after the last transfusion if one was given within the last 3 months (on a form with an original stamp);</li><li>- anti-erythrocyte antibodies – valid for 3 months or after the last transfusion if one was given within the last 3 months (on a form with an original stamp);</li><li>- tests for infectious diseases: RW, HBs antigen, antibodies to HCV, HIV – valid for 3 months;</li><li>- electrocardiogram (ECG) – valid for 14 days;</li></ul></li></ul><br/>It is worth noting that the port system is usually implanted before systemic antitumor drug therapy (chemotherapy), and the set of tests and examinations is identical to those required for chemotherapy. Thus, you will not need to collect them twice. It is only necessary to correctly determine the timing of port placement. Provide the supervising physician with copies of medical documents about the oncological disease and prior treatments.<br/><br/><b>Preparation for port system placement on the day of the procedure:</b><br/><br/><ul class='list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2'><li>Be sure to bring your passport and copies of documents if they were not submitted in advance.</li><li>Have a light breakfast in the morning; then refrain from eating for 6 hours and avoid any liquids for 2 hours before the scheduled port placement time.</li><li>Take routine medications, except for blood-thinning drugs (this should be agreed with the treating physician in advance).</li><li>Shower beforehand and, if necessary, remove hair at the implantation site. Note: we recommend wearing dark clothing.</li></ul><br/><br/><b>After the procedure</b><br/><br/>Usually, about 2 hours after port implantation the patient is ready to go home. Within a month one can fully return to normal life. The port system is one of the safest implantable devices: complications occur in less than 2% of patients.<br/><br/><b>Care recommendations for the port system</b><br/><br/>A port system can be implanted for a long term (several years or lifelong). With regular use, special care is not required because the system is flushed before and after use.<br/>However, if a break in treatment is planned, the port system should be flushed every 4 weeks. If the patient has entered stable remission, the port system can be removed. The removal procedure is also performed under local anesthesia.<br/><br/><b>Important:</b><ul class='list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2'><li>Keep the card with the port system data and diagnosis, as well as the technical passport of the port system. Carry it with you, especially when moving to other cities or countries. Always inform medical personnel about the presence of a port system when undergoing CT or MRI (the port can be used to administer contrast agents).</li><li>The port system may ONLY be used with special Huber needles. Always confirm their availability with medical staff to avoid deformation of the silicone septum.</li><li>Symptoms that require immediate medical attention:<br/><ul class=' list-inside space-y-2 ml-6'><li>- burning sensation, pain, fever above 38°C, redness and swelling at the implantation site;</li><li>- swelling of the arm or bluish discoloration of the skin on the side of the implanted port system;</li><li>- pain during infusion of medications through the port system.</li></ul></li></ul>"

      "about": "Digital diagnosis of skin neoplasms is a modern, highly accurate method of examining the skin to detect any formations such as moles, pigmented spots, and nevi, and determine whether they are benign or malignant. This computerized examination allows early detection of malignant skin neoplasms, particularly melanoma. Studies show that planned dermatoscopy using AI increases early melanoma detection by 20%.<br/><br/><b>Why use AI-assisted dermatoscopy?</b><br/><br/>Digital skin neoplasm diagnosis is applied for:<br/><ul class='list-disc mt-1 space-y-2 list-inside'><li>Early detection of malignant skin neoplasms, including melanoma;</li><li>Differential diagnosis between benign and malignant neoplasms;</li><li>Detection of parasitic skin conditions (lice, demodicosis, scabies, etc.);</li><li>Detection of bacterial, viral, and fungal skin infections;</li><li>Assessment of nail plate condition;</li><li>Investigating causes of hair loss (alopecia).</li></ul><br/><b>When is digital skin neoplasm diagnosis important?</b><br/><br/>Indications include:<br/><ul class='list-disc mt-1 space-y-2 list-inside'><li>Uneven skin growths;</li><li>Irregular skin color (especially black-blue shades);</li><li>Changes in size, shape, or color of a lesion;</li><li>Itching, burning, or pain in a pigmented spot;</li><li>Bleeding or ulceration of any lesion;</li><li>High number of moles with light hair color;</li><li>Moles larger than 0.5 cm in diameter;</li><li>Appearance of lesions during pregnancy;</li><li>Lesions in individuals over 60 years old;</li><li>Family history of melanoma;</li><li>Pre-surgical assessment of any skin lesion.</li></ul><br/>Important: These symptoms may be early signs of malignant skin neoplasms. Consultation with a specialist is necessary. Health-Direct’s experienced oncologist-dermatologists conduct comprehensive AI-assisted digital skin diagnosis using the FotoFinder system.<br/><br/>AI-assisted dermatoscopy should be performed annually for individuals at risk of malignant skin neoplasms:<br/><ul class='list-disc mt-1 space-y-2 list-inside'><li>Frequent prolonged sun exposure;</li><li>Repeated trauma to moles or pigmented spots (from clothing, combing, etc.);</li><li>Regular chemical exposure;</li><li>Age-related skin changes.</li></ul><br/><br/><b>How is digital skin neoplasm diagnosis performed?</b><br/><br/>No preparation is needed. The patient undresses to underwear, and a special gel is applied. Using the FotoFinder system, the skin is photographed from multiple angles. FotoFinder detects preclinical-stage neoplasms, invisible to the naked eye, with 140x magnification. Examining one lesion takes 1–3 minutes; the full procedure usually lasts about an hour. Data is analyzed in the Moleanalyzer program, which compares the patient’s neoplasms with a global database using AI, generating a report on malignancy, benignity, or borderline nature. AI combined with oncologist-dermatologist expertise provides up to 98% accuracy. Patients receive a detailed report and a mole map to monitor new skin lesions.<br/><br/><b>Important!</b><br/><br/>Early detection of malignant skin neoplasms enables minimally invasive treatment with positive outcomes.

The main goal of such studies is to identify molecular targets for personalized selection of targeted therapy for malignant tumors when standard therapy is ineffective. Often, patients conduct these studies independently. The result is a multi-page report that can only be interpreted by specialists.<br/><br/>The Health-Direct team offers the “Molecular Consortium” service. Leading specialists in drug therapy and molecular genetics interpret the results of comprehensive genomic sequencing and propose possible personalized targeted treatment options."
