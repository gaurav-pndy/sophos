After our conversation, I calmed down and agreed to hospitalization. The surgery lasted 9.5 hours and after it, the entire staff was by my side. Every day I communicated with the team and was amazed at how attentive and positive the doctors were and how kind and caring the nurses were. I gradually recovered by the sixth day and am preparing for discharge. I have only positive impressions of the Soyuz Clinic and its work. Huge thanks for saving me. I thank God I ended up here.

This second chance at life was given by wonderful doctor Valentina Mikhailovna Nechushkina and her team. My story began in autumn 2022 with an acute abdomen, difficulty breathing, scapula pain, abdominal swelling. Examination revealed unfortunate diagnosis—stage III high-grade ovarian cancer with ascites. Oncology dispensary suggested chemotherapy then surgery. I searched for a surgeon. Thank God I met an acquaintance who recommended the International project \"Health-Direct\" and the Eurasian Oncology Program (EAFO), consulting the best oncologists. So I came to Valentina Mikhailovna Nechushkina. She explained everything in detail (including diagrams) about the diagnosis, consequences, and treatment. Successful treatment depends on primary complete cytoreductive surgery, followed by chemotherapy. Leaving the office, I felt like on wings. After signing the contract, I was in the hands of a professional team focused on results. Attentiveness and kindness of doctors and the possibility of staying in touch at all stages impressed me. The complex surgery lasted 11 hours removing 14 items including liver ligament, uterus with adnexa, metastases with rectum, greater omentum, spleen, pancreas, stomach wall, gall bladder, appendix. Later I learned such surgeries involve multi-specialists: abdominal surgeons, urologists, etc. World-class surgeons Valentina Mikhailovna Nechushkina and Kirill Alexandrovich Shemyatovsky performed full cytoreduction. Deep gratitude to surgeons, project leader Dr. Soma, anesthesiologist Aleksey Olegovich Prikhodchenko, intensivists Oleg Vladislavovich Baydal, Pavel Viktorovich Vyatkin, nurses, secretaries.

Cancer patients often hear, ‘We are not gods...’ Maybe so, but not about wonderful surgeon, gynecologist, oncologist Valentina Mikhailovna Nechushkina. All patients and colleagues say: ‘She’s second only to God! Valentina Mikhailovna is the hands of God in our world!’ Diagnosed with stage III ovarian cancer with peritoneal metastases in Feb 2022. Terrified and confused how to start treatment, living in a small town with previous regular checks but late diagnosis due to negligence or low doctor professionalism. Life depended on surgeon’s professionalism. Blessed I found Valentina Mikhailovna! You immediately feel safe with her. After thorough evaluation and long consultation, surgery lasted 9 hours. Local surgeon was shocked seeing discharge papers ‘Wow you had half your abdomen removed!’ But I remain alive thanks to Valentina Mikhailovna and team. Post-op she guided chemo and genetic tests, found hereditary gene mutation, prescribed expert treatment unknown locally, monitors my course, is always reachable day or night. Dear women facing similar situations: don’t hesitate—only Valentina Mikhailovna. She’s unsurpassed, confirmed by patients and doctors. Other doctors praise her surgery and skill. Dear Valentina Mikhailovna, God bless you and your team! Sincere thanks to Dr. Soma, Kirill Alexandrovich Shemyatovsky, Aleksey Olegovich Prikhodchenko, Pavel Viktorovich Vyatkin, Oleg Vladislavovich Baydal. God bless!"

Husband found a doctor through a friend who advised Health-Direct. It felt like a different world. Clear plan given first by phone. First, met Valentina Mikhailovna Nechushkina in person. Skeptical about reviews, but after five minutes knew she was the right doctor. Consultation lasted three hours; she patiently answered questions without hurry or condescension. First impression: my doctor! Within five days, completed 19 complicated diagnostics thanks to Health-Direct managers. Most frightening was surgery, but Valentina Mikhailovna reassured. Long-term collaboration with the same anesthesia team ensures great results. Next day after surgery, I could sit and walk around ICU. Transferred to my room, care continued. Simple things like hydration, walking, diet, and social interaction quickly restored me. Immense gratitude to Valentina Mikhailovna and her team!"

Thankfully, smart and sensible people nearby advised me to contact Health-Direct. That month flew by like a fast train, and only now do I realize how much had to be done and why. We got confirmation that the cancer was only in the lung. Then I went for more testing to find out what kind of cancer I had. After all this, I received my first chemotherapy session in December. Chemotherapy was administered by oncologist Dmitry Yuryevich Sinyavin, who also supervised my care. He is a very attentive and responsible doctor. I had a total of six chemotherapy sessions. After four sessions, based on the oncology board’s decision, Dmitry Yuryevich advised radiation therapy. I underwent 30 sessions. One month after that, a CT scan showed positive progress. This gave me hope, but the last two chemotherapy infusions were difficult for me. It turned out that a whole team of doctors was involved, and they got me to my last session on time. Now, I am completely cancer-free! Looking back at the past six months, I am immensely grateful to oncologist Dmitry Yuryevich Sinyavin, radiotherapist Aleksandr Evgenyevich Pankratov, and the entire Health-Direct team for the correct treatment plan (it was very different from what would have been given where I live)! More such doctors, please! Thanks to you, I can go on living and see my newly born granddaughter grow up!",
